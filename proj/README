CONCEPT
  An interactive typewriter demonstrating the following:
    Application of textures in OpenGL
    Proper use of lighting
    First person perspective projection
    Selection in three dimensions
    Synchronization of visual behaviors

COMPILE
  $ make

RUN
  $ typewriter

LOCAL CONFIG
  Windows OS 10 with mounted Ubuntu terminal
  Start Xming
  $ export DISPLAY=:0.0
  $ ./typewriter

KEY BINDINGS
q, ESC   quit program
r        reset view to default
arrows   change angular view
w,a,s,d  change lateral position
         forward, left, backward, right
F/f      increase/decrease field of view (zoom)
z        increase elevation (eye height)
x        decrease elevation (eye height)

Time Estimation
+ 2h -> initial setup
+ 8h -> setup and typewriter keys (construction and making textures)
+ 4h -> c to c++ debugging, typewriter body and key adjustments
+ 5h -> 3d selection research/setup
+ 4h -> 3d selection research/reversal

To-Do List
  Typewriter body/box
  Increase body vertices for lighting
  Fix key pins/rods
  Hammer area
  Paper roll/carriage/tray
  Paper itself
  Fix lighting source
  Interactivity - key pressing
  Interactivity - hammer motion
  Interactivity - paper update
  Interactivity - carriage return
